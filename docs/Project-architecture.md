# Overview of the projcet architecture

Our project program went from a simple command-line application, which only had to output two types of repository analysis depending on a given mode, to also having to store the repository analysis in a Database. As seen in the use-case diagram below, it illustrates how our program now includes a backend, which in this case is our database.
